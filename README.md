# SVM using stochastic gradient descent

“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems.

## Usage

```python
import svm_sk

svm_sk.fit(X_train,Y_train) 
svm_sk.predict(X_test) 

```
